          <p>    Knomi was inspired by and created for holistic health. We feel
            that becoming healthier can take on many forms, be it emotional,
            physical, mental, or any other area of your life that needs improvement.
            In the pursuit of becoming a healthier individual, it can be hard
            to make changes in your life without upsetting the other parts of your
            life. It can also be difficult to know whether the changes you make are
            helping or hurting you. Knomi is a tool for those who want to be able
            to track and visualize their life changes.

        <h2>How does Knomi work?</h2>
        <div class="content-border">
          <p>    Knomi works as a personalized self-reporting tracking application inspired by
            some of the most helpful tracking apps out there. Knomi is an all-in-one
            way for you to track different parts of your life that may be factors
            in your overall health. You begin by picking and choosing things you'd
            like to keep track of over time. Would you like to watch your nutrition?
            You can input your calorie or macro-nutrient intake daily. Perhaps you may
            want to watch how exercising two times a week affects your daily emotions.
            Knomi will allow you to report your excersize sessions and rate how your
            feeling each day. You can even use Knomi as a personal journal.
          </p>

          <p>    Logging your life doesn't do much without being able to review it.
            Knomi will allow you to see reports that will inform you on how your changes
            are changing you over time. Useful statistics and graphs are provided so
            that you can plainly see how your behaviors or actions may be affecting you.
            Knomi allows you to make observations and understand trends in your life
            that help you know where you are and what you still want to change.
